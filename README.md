Welcome to Chess V2 by Olu Adelokiki.
As you may or may not be able to tell, this is my first real project in javascript, and  one of my firs treal deep dives into Object Oriented programming as a whole.
I learned a lot on this project, and had to come up with some fairly interesting solutions throught thte project. I've never had to programmatically interact with the DOM before now, and now that I have, I feel a bit more confident in my skills a a developer. This project, though small, went through hours upon hours of refactoring, attempts at optimization(no matter how small), and was quite honestly a lot of fun for me.

Some concepts that I really enjoyed getting to put into practice:
    - i  got to try out the limitations of javascript as far as truly object oriented language, and was able to find decent solutions to some of javascripts shortcoming sin these areas.
    - I got fairly comfortable with file I/O in the DOM
    - I really got to solidify some of my use cases for Objects, Variables, and Data Structures.
    - I also developed my understanding of product layers, and what it means when an Object (which it should never do), exposes internal structure.
    -I got to play around with the way that I defined classes, As there were originally supposed to be more specific piece classes, but I decided against it, and used a .type attribute as a workaround for some of js's method overloading limitations, and well as the equal time complexity for checking typeof(foo) as opposed to .type == foo.
    -Overall I really started to get a bit more excited about programming, as this was one of my first personal projects, and I got to learn a lot about my workflow, as well as the parts of the process that I can see myself wanting to work on a lot more.
